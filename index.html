          <p class="collapsed">Yes. This study is all about looking at relationship dynamics when either partner uses porn, so we need to have both partners in a relationship fill out their respective questionnaires. We have no ability to use data from only one partner, Sorry! If you have more than one partner, work with the partner you are most sexually active with, or watch the most porn with.</p>
